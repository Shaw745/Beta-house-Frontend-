 Since there wasnâ€™t enough time to fully implement the property search button, I decided to move the filters (such as location and number of bedrooms) into the More Filters section instead. This way, users can still search and refine the properties they are looking for, without relying directly on the backend search button. The approach still provides the same result for the user but in a slightly different workflow.
